A Jukebox based on the ENEL353 Assignment at University of Canterbury, New Zealand


Taken from handout:
This project requires the use of a small speaker driven by an audio amplifier and
interfaced to a microprocessor. The microprocessor will store one of several
“tunes”. On demand the embedded system will play a selected tune through a
digital to analogue converter (DAC), pre-amplifier, amplifier and speaker. Each
“tune” will be kept in a table in memory and a selection made from the keypad. A
human-interface using a 7-Segment LED display will be required to prompt the
user for a song. Waveform data can be generated using a spreadsheet program such
as Excel, or a mathematical tool such as MATLAB. These data will be stored in
memory and output to a digital-to-analogue converter for amplification, and
ultimately heard by users as musical sequences. Monotone sequences are sufficient
for this project, however polymorphic tones (use of harmonics) are encouraged.
